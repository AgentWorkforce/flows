Captured verification at the review-fix source. Commands and output below are verbatim (absolute paths included): relayflowd is built from this tree by the kernel-build command, and both live suites run against that binary. [full-suite-final.log](full-suite-final.log) is the earlier full-suite transcript from before the review fixes (head a50a8de); it records that run's environment failures and does not cover the review-fix changes.

# DRIVE-LOG — honest per-tick record of the flows drive loop

Append-only. One dated entry per tick. A tick that failed verification or
review is logged as failed — never reported as completed (fail closed).

## 2026-08-27 — tick on `flow/drive-9f07ffc-08270827` (base `9f07ffc`)

**Work package:** WP-1 — close gate-1 ladder rung (a) (from `ops/NEXT.md`,
consumed by this tick; source: `docs/bootstrap-report.md` §"Next three work
packages"). Exhaustive SIGKILL sweep for the pure deterministic hello flow
(before step 1, between every step pair, after the final effect, mid-step),
resume through the real `relayflowd resume` CLI, kill-under-`serve`,
journal-derived budget-exactness assertion, explained dead-attempt
`completionReason`s, plus the three bootstrap review observations
(`JournalClient.runStart` typed at the kernel dialect; `next_actions`
returns timers for all backing-off steps; `sdk/dist/` untracked) and a
repo-local cargo setup (`kernel/.cargo/config.toml` + vendored sources) so
the test gate runs despite the machine's broken `~/.cargo/registry` symlink.

**Verify (re-run by the Lead on the PR branch at log time, no manually
exported env vars):**

- `cd kernel && cargo test --workspace` — **33 passed, 0 failed** (suites:
  5+3+19+1+5, exit 0). Verbatim tail of the run:

  ```
     Doc-tests relayflowd_journal

  running 0 tests

  test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
  ```

- `cd kernel && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` — exit 0, tail:
  `Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.08s`
- `cd kernel && cargo fmt --check` — exit 0, no output.
- `cd sdk && npm test` — exit 0, verbatim tail:

  ```
   Test Files  5 passed (5)
        Tests  50 passed (50)
     Start at  09:07:44
     Duration  364ms (transform 171ms, setup 0ms, collect 448ms, tests 74ms, environment 0ms, prepare 240ms)
  ```

**Review verdict:** REVIEW_PASSED — inferred from workflow gating (the `pr`
step only runs after the adversary step's `output_contains: REVIEW_PASSED`
verification, and the PR exists); the review transcript itself was not
persisted to the repo.

**PR:** [#2 — Close Gate 1 deterministic crash-resume rung](https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/flows/pull/2)
(open, awaiting human review/merge).

**Honest state of gate 1:** rung (a) is closed *on the branch*, not on
`main` — it becomes true only when PR #2 merges. Rung (b) (the `llm` step +
protocol verbs `worker.attach`, `step.heartbeat`, `step.complete`,
`run.watch`, `stream.*`, `event.emit`) and rung (c) (the `agent` step +
Appendix A pins) do not exist yet, so gate 1's done-when does not hold.
Two things a human should weigh at merge: (1) the cargo-registry fix
vendors all locked crate sources into `kernel/vendor/` — ~2.9M inserted
lines of third-party code in the PR diff; deliberate, but it is a repo-size
trade-off worth ratifying explicitly. (2) The tick's `ops/NEXT.md` commit
(`7dd08f6`) landed directly on `origin/main` rather than only on the flow
branch — harmless (docs-only) but off-process; the drive workflow's
sync/pr steps should be checked so drive commits stay on `flow/` branches.

**Likely next package:** WP-2 — gate-1 rung (b): implement the `llm` step
kind and the missing protocol verbs, per the bootstrap report's queue —
*unless* the next tick's assess finds PR #2 awaiting review fixes, in which
case the package is fixing it (no new work over unfinished work).
